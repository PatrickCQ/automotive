        This document, the Gen2 core specification, describes the Gen2 messaging layer. The companion specification Gen2 transport details the mapping of the messaging layer to selected transports.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document describes the messaging layer. The separation between transport and messaging layer improves readability and simplify extending Gen2 to further transports in the future. The Gen2 messaging layer uses a RESTful design with an interface and a data model.</p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The acronym 'Gen2' is used to refer to this document, the second generation specification. The acronym 'VSS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Signal Specification' which is defined by the GENIVI Alliance. The term 'WebSocket' when used in this document, is as defined in the W3C WebSocket API and the WebSocket Protocol.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-dfn-for="data-model">
      <h2>Data model</h2>
      <p>
      The basic data model behind that can be accessed with this interface is a tree-like logical taxonomy of the whole vehicle.
      It is represented by a directed acyclic graph.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is derived from <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/blob/master/README.md">GENIVI's Vehicle Signal Specification</a> (VSS).
      <span class="issue">is this the correct link?</span>
      This <a href="#tree-example">example</a> shows that major vehicle structures (e.g. body, engine) are near the top of the tree and the logical assemblies and components that comprise them, are defined as their child nodes.
      Each of the child nodes in the tree is further decomposed into its logical constituents, 
      and the process is repeated until leafs are reached.
      </p>
      <p>
      A node in the tree can have one of two types.
      Leafs in the tree are <a>values</a>. 
      The path to a leaf is built by <a>branches</a>.

            <li>One or more segments in a path can be replaced by wildcards.</li>
            <li>If the wildcard is inserted at the last segment in a path, then it represents not only this segment, but any number of following segments.</li>
            <li>The service discovery method, which implies a search for all nodes having the provided path as root node, shall not have a wildcard at the last segment in the path if the entire tree below the specified root node is what is requested.</li>

          <h2>Examples</h2>
          <p>A client read request for the door lock status of all doors. There are two path segments specifying a particular door, the "RowX" and the "Left/Right" segments, so to cover all doors of the car both these segments must have a wildcard inserted.<br>
          <blockquote>
            "path": "/Vehicle/Cabin/Door/*/*/IsLocked"<br>
          </blockquote>
          The response would then contain the lock status of all doors like below.<br>
          <blockquote>
            "value": [ {" /Vehicle/Cabin/Door/Row1/Right/IsLocked" : true },<br>
            {" /Vehicle/Cabin/Door/Row1/Left/IsLocked" : true },<br>
            {" /Vehicle/Cabin/Door/Row2/Right/IsLocked" : false },<br>
            {" /Vehicle/Cabin/Door/Row2/Left/IsLocked" : true } ]<br>
          </blockquote>
          A client service discovery request for all doors of the car. In this case it is implied that the response shall contain the nodes in any branches below the root node indicated by the path, so there is no need to add a wildcard as the last segment.<br>
          <blockquote>
            "path": "/Vehicle/Cabin/Door"<br>
          </blockquote>
          The response to the path above will include all nodes in any branches, to any deep, below the root node Door as denoted in the path.<br>
          If only the direct children of the Door node is of interest, the path then should have one wildcard appended after the Door path segment.<br>
          <blockquote>
            "path": "/Vehicle/Cabin/Door/*"<br>
          </blockquote>
          And for the case of getting two generations of children to the Door node, two wildcards needs to be appended.<br><br>However, for any other action than a service discovery, the path above, ending with a wildcard, would lead to the return of all leave nodes at any depth under the Door node.
