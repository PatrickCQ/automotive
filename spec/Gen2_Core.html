      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document describes the messaging layer. The separation between transport and messaging layer improves readability and simplify extending VSI to further transports in the future. The VSI messaging layer uses a RESTful design with an interface and a data model.</p>

      <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The acronym 'VSI' is used to refer to this document, the 'Vehicle Service Interface' specification.The acronym 'VSS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Signal Specification' which is defined by the GENIVI Alliance.The term 'WebSocket' when used in this document, is as defined in the W3C WebSocket API and the WebSocket Protocol.</p>

      <h2>Data model</h2>
		<p>
		The basic data model behind that can be accessed with this interface is tree-like logical taxonomy of the whole vehicle. 
		It is represented by a directed acyclic graph.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It is already known and used in the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS).
		This example shows that major vehicle structures (e.g. body, engine) are near the top of the tree and the logical assemblies and components that comprise them, are defined as their child nodes. 
		Each of the child nodes in the tree is further decomposed into its logical constituents, 
		and the process is repeated until leaf nodes are reached. 
		A leaf node is a node at the end of a branch that cannot be decomposed because it represents a single signal or data attribute value. 
		An example VSS tree is shown below, its contents are illustrative:

      <h2>Filtering</h2>
	  <p>Most times it is not the best way to get a whole part of the data representation from the service and looking for a specific set with a specific value.
	  This section describes how to build the queries to search for specific parts of the data representation.
	  </p> 
		<p>A <dfn>query</dfn> is a description to filter a result in an specific form.</p>
		<p>The <a>query</a> can be given with the request from a client to a service additionally to the <a>path</a> to get a <a>content</a> response.
		The <a>query</a> describes certain rules that filter the <a>content</a> response. Next to the rules the expected <a dfn="node">nodes</a> are given.
		<ul>
			<li>path: describing the part of the tree that shall be filtered in</li>
			<li>nodes: the type of node that shall be returned</li>
			<li>rules: these have to match in the nodes for the node to be part of the <a>content</a> response.</li>
		<ul>
		</p>
		<section id="filter-example">
			<h3>Example</h2>
			<p>		
			All open doors shall be given. The tree looks as follows:
			<blockquote>
				<ul><li>/vehicle/cabin
					<ul><li>/Row1
						<ul><li>/Left
							<ul><li>/Door
								<ul>
									<li>isLocked: true</li>
									<li>open: false</li>
								</ul>
							</li></ul>
						</li></ul>
						<ul><li>/Right
							<ul><li>/Door
								<ul>
									<li>isLocked: false</li>
									<li>open: true</li>
								</ul>
							</li></ul>
						</li></ul>
					</li></ul>
					<ul><li>/Row2
						<ul><li>/Left
							<ul><li>/Door
								<ul>
									<li>isLocked: false</li>
									<li>open: false</li>

						</li></ul>
						<ul><li>/Right

								</ul>
							</li></ul>
						</li></ul>
					</li></ul>
				</li></ul>
			</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
			The <a>path</a> that shall be inspected is "/vehicle/cabin". <br>
			The <a>node</a> that shall be returned is "/vehicle/cabin/*/*/Door".<br>
			The <a>rule</a> is that "/vehicle/cabin/*/*/Door/isLocked" shall be "true".<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			The list in the <a>content</a> response would look like this:
